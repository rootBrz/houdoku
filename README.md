## Stack

**Application**: This is an Electron application. The majority of the functionality is performed in the renderer thread. Exceptions are for cases like accessing the window class (i.e. to support minimizing the window), locating application directories, and for working with extensions. The renderer can invoke these functions through ipc.

**UI**: The interface uses React components. Most base components (text, buttons, links, etc.) come from [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/).

**State**: [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org) is used for state management. Hooks are used for small
non-shared behavior.

**Storage**: Library data and settings are saved with `localStorage`. Thumbnails are stored in
the user-data path.

**Plugins/Extensions**: See the [Tiyo](https://github.com/xgi/tiyo) repo. Dynamic loading is handled by [aki-plugin-manager](https://github.com/xgi/aki-plugin-manager).

## Content Sources

Houdoku allows users to import manga from their filesystem (e.g. as zip files
or folders of images). To read manga from 3rd-party "content sources", the
Tiyo plugin can be installed from the Plugins tab in the client.
